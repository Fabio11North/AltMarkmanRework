# Alt-Marksman Revolver Rework
A simple mod that reworks the Alt-Marksman Revolver.

## List of Changes
- Now, instead of throwing a regular gold coin, you throw a slightly bigger **Silver Coin**.
- Silver coins can be shot twice before being destroyed. Whenever you shoot a silver coin, it bounces upwards.
- Silver coins are around 25% bigger than a regular coin, thus, are easier to hit.
- Reduced the amount of Alt-Marksman Revolver charges, from 4 to 2 (and changed the revolver display accordingly).
- Increased the coin reload time, from 4s to 6.5s

## Installation
- Install BepInEx.
- Make sure you also have [Configgy](https://thunderstore.io/c/ultrakill/p/Hydraxous/Configgy/) installed.
- Exract and copy `\plugins\SlabManBuff.dll` file into the `\BepInEx\plugins\` folder.
